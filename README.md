MBProgressHUD-OSX
=================

A fork and conversion of Matej Bukovinski's MBProgressHUD for iOS to run on OS X. 
The MBProgressHUD class is still iOS compatible and can be deployed for either platform.
The MBProgressHUD class also supports ARC and Non-ARC compilation.

For OS X, I also used Kelan Champagne's YRKSpinningProgressIndicator, replacing
the OS X NSProgressIndicator.
